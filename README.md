This program is a simple public online chat application where multiple people can send and reply to each other's messages (very similar to group chat feature in modern chat applications).


### Built With:
- React- Fronted end
- Python- Serverside
- Flask- Microframework
- PostgreSQL- Database
- Socket.io (Websocket)- For full duplex TCP communication channel


### Known Problems:
- One of the issue I am having in this version is that user cannnot send any message of length longer than 120 characters.
